        <p>Compound selector
            A sequence of simple selectors that are not separated by a combinator.
            A compound selector represents a set of simultaneous conditions on a single element. 
            A given element is said to match a compound selector when the element matches all 
            the simple selectors in the compound selector.</p>
            
        <p>In a compound selector, the type selector or a universal selector 
            in a compound selector must come first in the sequence of selectors. 
            Only one type selector or universal selector is allowed in the sequence. 
            Since whitespace represents the descendant combinator, no whitespace 
            is allowed between the simple selectors in a compound selector.</p>
