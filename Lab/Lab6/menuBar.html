        <h2>A World Without Email</h2>
        <p>Reimagining Work in an Age of Communication Overload
            FROM NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING AUTHOR CAL NEWPORT COMES 
            A BOLD VISION FOR LIBERATING WORKERS FROM THE TYRANNY OF 
            THE INBOX–AND UNLEASHING A NEW ERA OF PRODUCTIVITY.
            Advance Praise for A World Without Email
            “A World Without Email crystallizes what so many of us 
            feel intuitively but haven’t been able to explain: the 
            way we’re working isn’t working. Cal Newport charts a 
            path back to sanity, offering a variety of road-tested 
            practices to help us escape the tyranny of our inboxes 
            and achieve a calmer, more intentional, and more productive working life.”
            —Drew Houston, cofounder and CEO of Dropbox
            
            “The future of work demands new tools of collaboration. 
            Cal Newport is on a quest to uncover better ways for knowledge 
            workers to collaborate. Out of this will come the new work space.”
            —Kevin Kelly, senior maverick for Wired
            
            “This new work from Cal Newport goes beyond hacking at the branches
            of the email problem and strikes right at the root of it. This is a bold, 
            visionary, almost prophetic book that challenges the status quo. If you 
            want to peer into what the future of work could look like, read this book now.”
            —Greg McKeown, New York Times bestselling author of Essentialism: 
            The Disciplined Pursuit of Less
            
            “When a Cal Newport book appears, I drop everything and read. With evidence 
            and examples from the cutting edge of programming to the factory floors of 
            a century ago, Newport makes a compelling argument that we can and will do 
            much, much better than email. Read this superb book. It might just change 
            your life; it’s changing mine.”
            —Tim Hartford, author of The Data Detective
            
            “This book is a call to action. Newport suggests that now is the time to 
            reimagine work with the specific goal of optimizing our brain’s ability to 
            sustainably add value. Don’t let your teams and organizations lose out any 
            further—read this book to help you get started.”
            —Leslie A. Perlow, author of Sleeping with Your Smartphone and professor of 
            leadership at Harvard Business School</p>
            
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Modern knowledge workers communicate constantly. Their days are defined by 
            a relentless barrage of incoming messages and back-and-forth digital 
            conversations–a state of constant, anxious chatter in which nobody can 
            disconnect, and so nobody has the cognitive bandwidth to perform 
            substantive work. There was a time when tools like email felt cutting 
            edge, but a thorough review of current evidence reveals that the 
            “hyperactive hive mind” workflow they helped create has become a 
            productivity disaster, reducing profitability and perhaps even slowing 
            overall economic growth. Equally worrisome, it makes us miserable. Humans 
            are simply not wired for constant digital communication.
            
            We have become so used to an inbox-driven workday that it’s hard to imagine 
            alternatives. But they do exist. Drawing on years of investigative reporting, 
            author and computer science professor Cal Newport makes the case that our 
            current approach to work is broken, then lays out a series of principles and 
            concrete instructions for fixing it. In A World without Email, he argues 
            for a workplace in which clear processes–not haphazard messaging–define 
            how tasks are identified, assigned and reviewed. Each person works on fewer 
            things (but does them better), and aggressive investment in support reduces 
            the ever-increasing burden of administrative tasks. Above all else, important 
            communication is streamlined, and inboxes and chat channels are no longer central to how work unfolds.
            
            The knowledge sector’s evolution beyond the hyperactive hive mind is inevitable. 
            The question is not whether a world without email is coming (it is), but whether 
            you’ll be ahead of this trend. If you’re a CEO seeking a competitive edge, 
            an entrepreneur convinced your productivity could be higher, or an employee 
            exhausted by your inbox, A World Without Email will convince you that the time 
            has come for bold changes, and will walk you through exactly how to make them happen.
